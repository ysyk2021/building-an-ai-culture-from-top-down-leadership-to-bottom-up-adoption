In this chapter, we will lay the foundation for understanding AI by exploring what it is and how it operates. Building an AI culture begins with a solid grasp of the technology that is shaping our world.

Defining Artificial Intelligence (AI)
-------------------------------------

**Artificial Intelligence (AI)** refers to the simulation of human intelligence in machines, enabling them to perform tasks that typically require human intelligence. These tasks include problem-solving, learning from experience, understanding natural language, and making decisions.

### The Core Components of AI

AI encompasses several core components, each contributing to its functionality:

1. **Machine Learning (ML):** ML is a subset of AI that focuses on developing algorithms and models that enable machines to learn from data and improve their performance over time.

2. **Deep Learning:** Deep learning is a subset of ML that employs neural networks inspired by the human brain to process vast amounts of data and extract meaningful patterns.

3. **Natural Language Processing (NLP):** NLP enables machines to understand, interpret, and generate human language, making it integral to applications like chatbots and language translation.

4. **Computer Vision:** Computer vision allows machines to interpret and analyze visual information from the world, enabling tasks like image recognition and object detection.

5. **Reinforcement Learning:** In reinforcement learning, machines learn by trial and error, receiving rewards or penalties based on their actions in specific environments.

How AI Works
------------

AI systems follow a general process when performing tasks:

1. **Data Collection:** AI systems collect and ingest data from various sources, such as sensors, databases, or the internet.

2. **Data Preprocessing:** Raw data is cleaned, transformed, and prepared for analysis to remove noise and inconsistencies.

3. **Feature Extraction:** Relevant features or patterns are extracted from the data to create input variables for AI models.

4. **Model Training:** Machine learning models are trained using historical data to learn patterns and relationships. Deep learning models may have multiple layers of neural networks for complex tasks.

5. **Inference:** Once trained, AI models can make predictions or decisions when presented with new, unseen data.

6. **Feedback Loop:** In reinforcement learning, the model receives feedback based on its actions and uses this information to improve over time.
